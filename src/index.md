# Welcome to Bluegrass Ruby

Bluegrass Ruby was started by [Jos O'shea](https://ruby.social/@whatnotery) in Spring of 2023 in hopes of bringing together Lexington's Ruby Community. We meet at 6:00 PM on the first Tuesday of each month at space graciously provided by [Awesome Inc](https://awesomeinc.org) at 348 East Main Street in downtown Lexington. Our next meeting will be <span id="meeting-date"></span>. See our Meetups through the navigation link, and also follow us on Mastodon for more updates!
