# Welcome to Bluegrass Ruby

 Bluegrass Ruby is a Ruby User Group for Rubyists in the central Kentucky region (and beyond). Bluegrass Ruby was started by [Jos O'shea](https://ruby.social/@whatnotery) in Spring of 2023 to learn about, elevate, and find community in Ruby not just in the bluegrass region but beyond it as well. We meet at 6:00PM on the third Tuesday of the month at space graciously provided to us by [Base110](https://www.basehere.com/base110) at 110 West Vine Street in downtown Lexington. See our Meetups through the navigation link for the Bluegrass Developers Guild Meetup page and follow us on Mastodon for more updates!
