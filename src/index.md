# Welcome to Bluegrass Ruby

Bluegrass Ruby was started by [Jos O'shea](https://ruby.social/@whatnotery) in Spring of 2023 in hopes of bringing together Lexington's Ruby Community. We meet at 6:00PM on the third Tuesday of the month at space graciously provided by [Base110](https://www.basehere.com/base110) at 110 West Vine Street in downtown Lexington. See our Meetups through the navigation link for the Bluegrass Developers Guild Meetup page and also follow us on Mastodon for more updates!
