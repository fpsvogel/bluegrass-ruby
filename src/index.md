# Welcome to Bluegrass Ruby

We meet at 6:00 PM on the first Tuesday of each month at [Awesome Inc](https://awesomeinc.org) at 348 E Main St in downtown Lexington, Kentucky.

Our next meeting will be <a id="meeting-date" href="https://guild.host/bluegrass-ruby/events/upcoming"></a>.

We also chat in the [Bluegrass Developers Guild](https://www.bluegrassdevs.org) Slack in the `#ruby` channel.

Our attendees are of varying experience levels, so you're welcome to join us even if you don't know Ruby yet!
