# Welcome to Bluegrass Ruby

**When?** We normally meet at 6:00 PM on the first Tuesday of each month, but be sure to check our [events page](https://guild.host/bluegrass-ruby/events) for exact dates.

**Where?** We meet at [Awesome Inc](https://awesomeinc.org) at 348 E Main St in downtown Lexington, Kentucky.

We also chat in the [Bluegrass Developers Guild](https://www.bluegrassdevs.org) Slack in the `#ruby` channel. (To join, fill out the form at "Join us!" in the top menu of the dev guild website.)

Our attendees are of varying experience levels, so you're welcome to join us even if you don't know Ruby yet!
