title: Bridgetown with Jared White
---

This month [Jared White](https://indieweb.social/@jaredwhite) joined us virtually to talk about new features in [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com), a next-generation progressive site generator and fullstack framework powered by Ruby.

The talk wasn't recorded, but much of what Jared shared with us was also covered in Jared's BridgetownConf 2022 keynote talk ["What's New in Bridgetown 1.2, the Plugin Ecosystem, and Content Publishing"](https://www.bridgetownconf.rocks/#talk-keynote), as well as his talk ["Database-Driven Apps with Bridgetown, Roda, Hotwire Turbo, and Lifeform"](https://www.bridgetownconf.rocks/#talk-bridgetown-database-apps).
