title: Legacy Rails + Phoenix apps
---

[Marli Baumann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marlibaumann/) gave us a glimpse into how her company maintains a legacy Rails app while developing a complementary Phoenix (Elixir) app.

Marli expanded our horizons on what's possible:

- Even in the earliest versions of Rails, it was possible to dynamically render parts of a page. A lot of what Hotwire does now is not essentially new; it's just more built into the framework.
- It's possible for two apps (Rails and Phoenix) to connect to each other's database.
- It's possible to hand-roll a cron-based background job scheduler.
