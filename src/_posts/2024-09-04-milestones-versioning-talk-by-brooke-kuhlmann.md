title: Milestones with Brooke Kuhlmann
---

At this month's meetup we enjoyed a talk by [Brooke Kuhlmann](https://mastodon.social/@bkuhlmann), "Milestones", about automated versioning and release note generation. We learned a lot!

A neat incidental takeaway from the talk, for any shortcut junkies out there, was learning about the app [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) and how to augment it in Ruby-related ways with Brooke's own project [Pennyworth](https://www.alchemists.io/projects/pennyworth).
