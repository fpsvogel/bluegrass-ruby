 Our first meetup, saw 7 Rubyist's show up from various walks of life and expierience levels. We did introductions and discussed projects we've worked on. Vera discussed her domain specific language for generative storytelling called [YeetWords](https://github.com/verachell/YeetWords),and Blake did a demo of [WhatIsMyDistrict.org](https://blakeshall.github.io/whats_my_district_redux/), a site for determing nearby public services and the city district your're in. Other discussions included testing strictness, and the helpfulness of AI in development.
