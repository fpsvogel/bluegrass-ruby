title: Game development with Gosu
---

[Vera Chellgren](https://github.com/verachell/) gave us a hands-on tour of the Gosu game development library for Ruby:

- We created a minimal example of a background image and player movement.
- We looked at two example Gosu games, ran them locally, and made some of our own changes to them:
  - [Star fighter tutorial](https://github.com/gosu/gosu-examples/blob/master/examples/tutorial.rb) (fly a spaceship to collect stars)
  - [Cptn-ruby](https://github.com/gosu/gosu-examples/blob/master/examples/cptn_ruby.rb) (platformer)
