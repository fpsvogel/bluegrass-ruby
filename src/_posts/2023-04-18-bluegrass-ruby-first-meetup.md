title: Bluegrass Ruby's first meetup
---

Our first meetup saw 7 Rubyists show up from various walks of life and experience levels. We did introductions and discussed projects we've worked on. Vera discussed her domain specific language for generative storytelling called [YeetWords](https://github.com/verachell/YeetWords), and Blake did a demo of [WhatIsMyDistrict.org](https://blakeshall.github.io/whats_my_district_redux/), a site for determining nearby public services and the city district you're in. Other discussions included testing strictness and the helpfulness of AI in development.
