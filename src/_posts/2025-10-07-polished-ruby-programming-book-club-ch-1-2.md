title: Polished Ruby Programming, Chs. 1-2
---

We're starting a book club on [Polished Ruby Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/polished-ruby-programming-9781801072724) by Jeremy Evans. Today we covered the first two chapters.

Our discussion included:

- The DragonRuby Game Toolkit and the local game dev group [RunJumpDev](https://runjumpdev.org/).
- Truthy, falsey, and [methods related to them](https://yizeng.me/2021/04/04/truhty-falsey-nil-any-empty-blank-present-in-ruby-and-ruby-on-rails/).
- Underused Ruby data types: Rational, Symbol, Set, Struct, and Data.
- SOLID principles: how Ruby ignores some of them, and how none of us has ever seen SOLID brought up in actual discussions at work and not just in interviews.
- Large vs. small classes.
