title: '"Out of the Book" with Henrique Kossovski'
---

We had a surprise speaker this month, Henrique (Henry) Kossovski, a UK student and entrepreneur who asked for the group's feedback on his nascent startup [Out of the Book](https://vace.uky.edu/news/out-book), an immersive storytelling platform.

Henry shared with us that he got the idea for Out of the Book when he was writing a story in which a character kills the reader, and leading up to that event he wanted the story to incorporate the reader's location and other details. Branching narratives, multimedia, and authoring tools are other features that Henry is building into the Out of the Book prototype.

The group discussed how product is at the intersection of books and video games, interactive fiction being the closest existing analogue.

We look forward to hearing more about Out of the Book as it develops!
